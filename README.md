Very simple script using OMDb API to lookup movies.

I plan to add capturing the formats I have the movie in.

Formats should be easy to add to, but standards would be: DVD, Blu-ray, Amazon, Google.

Personally I rip physical movies and put them on an external drive for easy playing.  But I want to have a single place to look for all my movies.

Also eventually would be nice to have a way to print out the catalog with enough info that we can flip through it (book) and know where to look for the media.
